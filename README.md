# SFMLtest

I was messing around with the external library SFML(Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in c++. 
I created an animated penguin that can jump around on platforms. This "game" includes gravity, music, and keyboard controls(A, D, Space) among other things.
I am still working on this. I have been working on this for about a week, watching tutorials, reading articles, and using the wiki. 
This program has reinforced my understanding of basic c++ procedures like classes and pointers as well as teaching me how to use external libraries.
Although I am uploading this to gitHub, I am excited to keep working on this and maybe start working on an actual game like snake, astroids, or pacman.
I will also be checking out DirectX in the future.
